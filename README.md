# Web Visualization Dashboard
[]()
## Background
Create a Visualization Dashboard Website of Weather in 500+ World Cities Relative to the Equator at Different Latitudes Using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 4
### Objectives 
In building this dashboard, create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### Website Requirements
#### The website contains 7 pages total, including:
- A Landing Page containing
- An explanation of the project
- Links to each visualizations page

- A paragraph describing the plot and its significance

#### A Comparisons Page that:
- Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so that it can be easily visually compared
- Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations
- The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens
- Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page
- Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named Plots which provides links to each individual visualization page
- Provides two more links on the right: Comparisons which links to the comparisons page, and Data which links to the data page
- Is responsive (using Media Queries). The nav's background color must change

#### A Data Page that:
- Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations
- The table must be a Bootstrap table component
- The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML
